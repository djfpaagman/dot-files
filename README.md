# My dot files
These are the config files I use to set up my system the way I like it. I use OS X but I guess it will also work on Linux. Please use at your own risk :)

## General setup
```sh
git clone git@github.com:djfpaagman/dot-files.git ~/.dot-files
```

## Vim
```sh
ln -s ~/.dot-files/vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/.dot-files/vim ~/.vim
```
